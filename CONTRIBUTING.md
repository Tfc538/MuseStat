## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MuseStat.git
cd MuseStat

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Run tests (when available)
pytest

# Run MuseStat
python main.py --help
```

## Project Structure

```
musestat/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/         # Core analysis logic
â”œâ”€â”€ features/     # Advanced features (readability, dialogue, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ io/           # File readers and exporters
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/           # Terminal UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/        # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ cli/          # Command-line interface
```

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Imports**: Organize as stdlib, third-party, local
- **Line Length**: Maximum 100 characters (soft limit)
- **Docstrings**: Use Google or NumPy style
- **Type Hints**: Use for all function parameters and returns
- **Error Handling**: Use specific exceptions, not bare `except`
- **Console Output**: Use Rich library for beautiful formatting

## Testing Guidelines

When adding new features:
- Test with manuscripts of varying sizes (small, medium, large)
- Test all supported file formats
- Test edge cases (empty files, very long chapters, etc.)
- Ensure error messages are helpful and clear
- Test both interactive and CLI modes

## Adding New Features

### For Analysis Features:
- Add to appropriate module in `features/`
- Update `core/analyzer.py` to integrate
- Add CLI flag if needed
- Update UI to display results
- Document in README.md

### For UI Components:
- Add to `ui/panels.py` or `ui/tables.py`
- Follow existing Rich UI patterns
- Ensure responsive to terminal width
- Test with different color schemes

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: Add character name frequency tracking
fix: Correct dialogue ratio calculation for curly quotes
docs: Update README with new --export-pdf option
perf: Optimize chapter detection for large manuscripts
```
