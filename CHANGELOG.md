- **Chapter Balance Visualization**: Color-coded consistency indicators in chapter statistics panel
  - Very Consistent (CV < 15%): Green
  - Moderately Consistent (CV < 30%): Yellow
  - Variable (CV ≥ 30%): Red
- **Chapter Density Heat Maps**: Visual representation of word and sentence density across chapters
  - High density areas shown as █
  - Low density areas shown as ░
  - Helps identify pacing variations at a glance
- **Mini-Bars in Tables**: Visual bars added to chapter breakdown table for quick length comparison

### Improved
- Readability table now includes color-coded indicators for at-a-glance assessment
- Chapter stats panel now displays sparkline trends for chapter lengths
