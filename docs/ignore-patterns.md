# üö´ Ignore Patterns Guide

**User-friendly guide to `.musestatignore` for writers**

---

## üéØ What is `.musestatignore`?

A file that tells MuseStat to **skip** certain lines when checking your manuscript. Perfect for:

- ‚úÖ Intentional style choices
- ‚úÖ Character names with special formatting
- ‚úÖ Foreign language text
- ‚úÖ Technical terms
- ‚úÖ Section headers you want to keep

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (3 steps)

### 1. Create the File

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .musestatignore.example .musestatignore

# Or create from scratch
touch .musestatignore
```

### 2. Add Patterns

Open `.musestatignore` in any text editor and add patterns:

```gitignore
# Ignore my character's name
_Minho_

# Ignore author notes
*Author's Note*

# Ignore appendix section
^## Appendix
```

### 3. Test It

```bash
python musestat.py -v
```

You'll see: "5 patterns loaded from .musestatignore"

---

## üìù Pattern Types (3 simple ways!)

### 1. **Plain Text** (Easiest!)

Just write the text you want to ignore. MuseStat will find it anywhere in a line.

**Examples:**
```gitignore
# Ignore any line with "TODO:"
TODO:

# Ignore character name
Protagonist_Name

# Ignore Korean text
ÌïúÍ∏Ä
```

**What it matches:**
- Case-insensitive (TODO: = todo: = ToDo:)
- Anywhere in the line
- Exact text match

---

### 2. **Wildcards** (Flexible!)

Use `*` to match anything, `?` to match one character.

**Examples:**
```gitignore
# Match any author note
*Author*

# Match "had had" or "had  had" (with extra space)
had*had

# Match any Korean marker
*[Korean]*

# Match character name variations
_Character?Name_
```

**What `*` does:**
- `*Author*` matches: "Author's Note", "Author Note:", "[AUTHOR]"
- `*TODO*` matches: "TODO:", "[TODO]", "**TODO**"
- `Character*` matches: "Character_Name", "Character123"

**What `?` does:**
- `Chapt?r` matches: "Chapter", "Chaptr"
- `had ?ad` matches: "had had", "had bad"

---

### 3. **Starts With** (Specific!)

Use `^` at the start to only match lines that begin with that pattern.

**Examples:**
```gitignore
# Only match lines starting with "## Appendix"
^## Appendix

# Only match chapter numbers at line start
^Chapter [0-9]

# Only match TODO at the very beginning
^TODO:
```

**Difference:**
- `TODO:` matches anywhere: "Note: TODO: fix this"
- `^TODO:` only matches at start: "TODO: fix this"

## üí° Common Patterns Library

### Character Names
```gitignore
# Underscored names
_Character_Name_
*_Protagonist*

# Special formatting
**Character**
*Character*
```

### Foreign Languages
```gitignore
# Korean
ÌïúÍ∏Ä
*[Korean:*

# Japanese
*[Japanese:*

# Spanish
*[Spanish:*

# Generic
*[Language:*
```

had had

# Emphatic repetition
that that
it it

said said
```

# Em-dash preference
 - 

# Ellipsis style
....

# Multiple punctuation (in dialogue)
!?
```

### Sections to Skip
```gitignore
# Back matter
^## Appendix
^## Glossary
^## Notes
^## References

## üîç Pattern Matching Rules

### Case Sensitivity
**All patterns are CASE-INSENSITIVE**

```gitignore
TODO: matches todo:, ToDo:, TODO:
Author matches author, AUTHOR, Author
```

### Where It Matches
- **Plain text**: Anywhere in line
- **Wildcards**: Anywhere (unless starting with ^)
- **Starts with (^)**: Beginning of line only

### Multiple Matches
If ANY pattern matches, the line is ignored. Patterns work together!

```gitignore
# Both patterns will ignore the line
*Author*
TODO:
```

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Patterns

### Step 1: Add Pattern
```gitignore
# Ignore my character's name
_Minho_
```

### Step 2: Run Verification
```bash
python musestat.py -v
```

### Step 3: Check Results
Look for:
```
Ignore patterns: 1 patterns loaded from .musestatignore
```

### Step 4: Verify It Works
If your pattern works, you'll see fewer issues!

**Before:**
```
üî¥ Errors: 10
  - Unmatched underscore (_) - "_Minho_"
```

**After:**
```
üî¥ Errors: 9
(No more _Minho_ errors!)
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
```gitignore
# ‚úÖ Good: Simple and clear
Author's Note

# ‚ùå Avoid: Too complex at first
\[Author'?s?\s+Note\].*
```

### 2. Add Comments
```gitignore
# ‚úÖ Good: Explained
# Ignore my character's special name format
_Minho_

# ‚ùå Avoid: No explanation
_Minho_
```

### 3. Test One at a Time
Add patterns gradually and test each time:

```bash
# Add one pattern
echo "_Minho_" >> .musestatignore

# Test it
python musestat.py -v

# Add another
echo "*Author*" >> .musestatignore

# Test again
python musestat.py -v
```

### 4. Use Wildcards Wisely
```gitignore
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific
*Author's Note*

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Careful: Very broad
*Note*
```

### 5. Document Your Choices
```gitignore
# Why I'm ignoring this:
# My writing style uses spaced hyphens for em-dashes
# This is intentional and not an error
 - 
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Pattern Not Working?

**Problem**: Pattern doesn't match

**Solutions**:
1. Check for typos
2. Try adding wildcards: `*pattern*`
3. Check case (remember: case-insensitive)
4. Test with simpler version

**Example:**
```gitignore
# Not working?
^## Appendix: References

# Try simpler:
Appendix

# Or with wildcard:
*Appendix*
```

---

### Too Many Lines Ignored?

**Problem**: Pattern too broad

**Solution**: Make it more specific

```gitignore
# ‚ùå Too broad (ignores ALL "Note")
Note

# ‚úÖ More specific
Author's Note

# ‚úÖ Even more specific
*[Author's Note]*
```

---

### Pattern Seems Ignored?

**Problem**: File not loaded

**Check**:
```bash
python musestat.py -v
```

Should see:
```
Ignore patterns: X patterns loaded
```

**Fixes**:
1. Make sure file is named `.musestatignore` (note the dot!)
2. Make sure it's in the same folder as your manuscript
3. Make sure lines don't start with #
