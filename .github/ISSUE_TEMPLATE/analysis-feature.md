## Analysis Feature

Which analysis feature needs enhancement?
- [ ] Dialogue Analysis
- [ ] Readability Metrics
- [ ] Language Analysis
- [ ] Verification Mode
- [ ] Chapter Statistics
- [ ] Text Processing
- [ ] Overall Statistics
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Current Behavior

How does the feature currently work?

## Proposed Enhancement

What improvement or addition do you suggest?

## Use Case

How would this help your writing workflow?

**Example:**
> As a fiction writer, I want to see dialogue broken down by chapter so that I can identify chapters that are too exposition-heavy or too dialogue-heavy.

## Specific Improvements

What specific metrics, visualizations, or outputs would you like?

### New Metrics
<!-- List any new statistics or measurements -->
- 
- 

### New Visualizations
<!-- Describe charts, graphs, or displays -->
- 
- 

### CLI Options
<!-- Suggest command-line flags -->
```bash
# Example
musestat -f book.txt --dialogue-by-chapter --min-dialogue 30%
```

## Example Output

Show an example of what the output would look like:

```
╭─ Dialogue Analysis by Chapter ─────────────╮
│ Chapter 1: The Beginning                   │
│   Dialogue: 45.2% (3,200 words)           │
│   Narration: 54.8% (3,890 words)          │
│   Status: ✓ Balanced                       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Chapter 2: The Journey                     │
│   Dialogue: 12.3% (890 words)             │
│   Narration: 87.7% (6,340 words)          │
│   Status: ⚠ Low dialogue                   │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────╯

## Writer Value

How does this help the author improve their manuscript?
- [ ] Identifies pacing issues
- [ ] Reveals structural problems
- [ ] Highlights consistency issues
- [ ] Provides comparative metrics
- [ ] Suggests improvements
- [ ] Tracks progress over time
- [ ] Industry standard compliance
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Target Genre/Format

Who would benefit most?
- [ ] Fiction writers (all genres)
- [ ] Specific genre: ___________
- [ ] Non-fiction writers
- [ ] Academic writers
- [ ] Screenwriters
- [ ] Technical writers
- [ ] All writers

## Complexity

How complex is this enhancement?
- [ ] Simple (new metric calculation)
- [ ] Medium (new analysis module)
- [ ] Complex (significant algorithm changes)
- [ ] Very complex (new research required)

## Dependencies

Would this require:
- [ ] New Python packages
- [ ] External libraries
- [ ] Additional data files
- [ ] API calls
- [ ] Machine learning models
- [ ] No new dependencies

## Performance Impact

What's the expected performance impact?
- [ ] Negligible (quick calculation)
- [ ] Minor (adds a few seconds)
- [ ] Moderate (could double analysis time)
- [ ] Significant (needs optimization strategy)
- [ ] Optional (can be disabled if slow)

## Affected Modules

Which parts of MuseStat would need changes?
- [ ] `core/analyzer.py`
- [ ] `features/dialogue.py`
- [ ] `features/readability.py`
- [ ] `features/language.py`
- [ ] `features/verification.py`
- [ ] `ui/display.py`
- [ ] `ui/tables.py`
- [ ] `io/exporters.py`
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Output Integration

Where should this appear?
- [ ] Main statistics display
- [ ] Chapter breakdown
- [ ] Verification mode
- [ ] Export files (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] New dedicated section
- [ ] Optional flag only

## Configuration

Should this be:
- [ ] Always calculated
- [ ] Optional flag (`--feature-name`)
- [ ] Part of advanced mode
- [ ] Configurable threshold
- [ ] User preference setting

## Research/Examples

Are there established standards or research for this?
- **Writing guides**: [e.g., "Show don't tell" percentage]
- **Industry standards**: [e.g., readability grades for audience]
- **Academic research**: [citation or link]
- **Similar tools**: [other tools that do this]

## Comparison

How do similar tools handle this?
- **Tool name**: [e.g., ProWritingAid, Hemingway]
- **Their approach**: [what they show/calculate]
- **How to improve**: [what could be better]

## Edge Cases

What special cases should be considered?
- [ ] Very short manuscripts
- [ ] Very long manuscripts
- [ ] Scripts/plays (all dialogue)
- [ ] Technical docs (no dialogue)
- [ ] Poetry
- [ ] Mixed language texts
- [ ] Non-standard formatting

## Backwards Compatibility

Would this change:
- [ ] Existing output format (breaking change)
- [ ] JSON/CSV export structure
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Nothing (purely additive)

## Documentation Needs

What documentation would be needed?
- [ ] CLI help text
- [ ] README feature list
- [ ] User guide examples
- [ ] FAQ entry
- [ ] Feature documentation page
- [ ] Algorithm explanation

## Testing Strategy

How should this be tested?
- [ ] Unit tests for calculations
- [ ] Integration tests with sample manuscripts
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Implementation Ideas

Do you have suggestions for implementation?

```python
# Pseudocode or ideas
def new_analysis_feature():
    # Your ideas here
    pass
```
